## Interrupt Overview

The Minx provides up to 32 hardware mapped interrupts and up to 96
software interrupts (for bios calls). The full list is defined in the
[BIOS section](PM_Bios "wikilink") of the standard. Out of the 32
interrupts, three are not maskable, $00\~$02.

On startup, **IRQ 0 (reset)** fires. Since BIOS resets the processor
state, it is unknown if this behaves like a normal IRQ.

## Interrupt Priority

The Minx interrupt hardware is impressive in it's configurability. The
29 maskable interrupts are divided into 9 groups. Each of these groups
are then provided a 2 bit priority encoder. These encoders define the
order in which IRQs are processed. IRQs are processed by priority first,
then by the internal IRQ number. If an IRQ group is assigned a priority
of 0, all the IRQs for the group are implicity disabled.

## Enabling Interrupts

All 29 of the maskable interrupts can be disabled in 3 ways. The first
way is if the interrupt disable flag or interrupt branch flag is set in
the Flag register. This will prevent all maskable IRQs from occuring.
The 2nd is by setting the IRQ group priority to zero. Finally, you can
reset the effective bit in the IRQ_ENA_\* register. If any of these
three conditions occur, the IRQ is effectively disabled.

Note: If registers V and U are different, IRQ will not be called.

## When Interrupts Occur

IRQs are set to "pending" on the rising edge of an event. Since IRQs are
not nessessarly processed immediately, they will remain in a waiting
state. This is where the IRQ_ACT_\* registers come in. At any point an
IRQ is enabled, and the respective bit in an IRQ_ACT_\* is set. The
down side to this is the IRQ will continue to fire until software clears
the bit by writing a logical '1' to the bit in IRQ_ACT_\*.

After an IRQ branch occurs, the interrupt branch flag is set, preventing
IRQs from colliding with one another.

## What is Not Known

It is unknown which interrupts are masked by the interrupt disable flag.
Additionally, there are aproximately 7 hardware interrupts which have
not been mapped and as such we don't know entire know all the details of
their behavior.
