## LCD Controller Overview

The Pokemon Mini LCD is a serial display with it's own on-board
framebuffer, and display settings. These are all abstracted by the
[PRC](PM_PRC "wikilink"), which handles display copies ($1000 \~ $12FF)
and other various functions. No commercial roms directly access the
display, relying on the PRC and BIOS to perform the various
communications. This allows for the PM to have hardware changes without
having to rely on the same display controller.

The display is driven by two data ports, $20FE and $20FF. Both ports are
read\\write, the only difference between them is one sets the CTRL line
when accessing the data port on the LCD. The port is 8-bits wide, and
has a small set of standard commands.

The LCD is probably using the on-glass <S>[SSD1828 LCD
controller](http://www.solomon-systech.com/products/ssd1828.htm) or
something very simliar.</S>[SED1565 LCD
Controller](http://www.bolymin.com.tw/Doc/SED1565.pdf)

The controller got <S>96x65</S> 132x65 Graphic Display Data RAM (GDDRAM)
with 96x64 pixels visible on the LCD. The additional RAM is for an
unused symbol driver. The PM most likely uses a parallel interface to
the controller, but serial interface might be available on the connector
of the LCD.

## LCD Controller Commands

Lower case "x" denotes parameters used by the command. A question mark
"?" denotes bits that are don't care.

The commands in this list are verified to work. The <S>SSD1828</S>
datasheet holds <S>much</S> more commands <S>that are hard</S>of which a
few are hard to verify <S>or didn't work</S> on the
PM.

**LCD Commands**

## Data reads/writes

Data can be read and written from/to the LCD at any time (but not when
contrast command was executed, this is a special case). The programmer
should make sure that the page and column address pointers are pointing
to the correct location.

When data was read or written the column address automatically increases
by one.

After executing page address and both of the column address set
operations data can be written to the selected location.
