## Cartridge Overview

The Pokemon Mini cartridge has a 21 bit addressing bus, which up until
recently has gone completely unused. Since the PM has a relatively wide
address space, it can provide up to a 2MB worth of data without
additional hardware. One of the more bizzare design choices by Nintendo
is that the cartridge address space starts relative to the beginning of
the Pokemon Mini's memory space, which is then overwritten by
[BIOS](PM_Bios "wikilink"), [RAM](PM_RAM "wikilink") and [Internal
Register](PM_Registers "wikilink"), making $2100 bytes of ROM space
inaccessible except through mirrors.

After the overloaded memory space, the Pokemon Mini has $D0 byte header
standard. The vast majority of this space is reserved for IRQ jump
locations. Much of the remaining space is plain asciiz info about the
game, with a couple of BIOS checked watermarks to verify a ROM is a PM
image.

Following the header is completely user mapped data. It is typical for
the reset IRQ location to simply jump to $21D0. The IRQ locations are 6
bytes in size to accommodate for a U load (3 bytes) and a long jump (3
bytes)
