This is simply a list of things I need to figure out.

  - The precise timing of a video frame. \<- Hmm, how precise?
  - <s>The number of cycles each value of PRC_CNT takes</s>
  - Which\\if timers sleep while the system is suspended
  - Check to see which IRQs are masked by the IRQ Enable and IRQ Branch
    flags
  - <s>Determine the approximate amount of time sprite draw, map draw,
    and frame copy take (maybe min \\ max \\ avg)</s>
  - <s>Determine when the PRC stages fire (relative to PRC_CNT)</s>
  - <s>Check undocument Minx instruction behavior</s>
    [Done](Talk:PM_InstructionList "wikilink")

.. to be continued ..
