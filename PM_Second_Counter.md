## Second Counter Overview

The second timer, while simple, was misunderstood for a good portion of
the initial reverse engineering process. SEC_CNT_\* provides a 24 bit
second counter that increments with a one second period (based of a
32768hz crystal) and can be enabled, disabled or reset to zero using the
SEC_CTL register. Initially, these registers were thought to be a
general purpose counter, but is actually one half of the system's real
time clock.

When a commercial game sets the time, it resets the timer and stores the
current time and date in the [EEPROM](PM_EEPROM "wikilink"). Calculating
the current time consists of simply adding the number of elapsed seconds
to the second counter. Each time the system boots, commercial games
compare the current seconds against a 24 bit value stored in EEPROM.
This was the last known valid time. If the current second counter is
less than the previous know valid, it is assumed that the clock is valid
and a game resumes running normally.

Under no circumstances should any homebrew software reset or pause the
second counter, as it will invalidate the time on the system. This
counter continues to tick even when the system is suspended.
