Open-Bus is a state in which no hardware on a data path is actively
responding to a request for data. In many cases this results in
bus-capacitance driving ghost data to the CPU. This means that when
reading from a non-existent hardware location, the CPU will see the last
data on the path (read or write). This often means that reading from
these locations will result in the data result of things being based
around the last instruction byte used, such as an opcode or an immediate
value.
